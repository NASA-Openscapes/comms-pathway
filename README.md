# Comms Pathway
This is where we are standing up a strategy & design plan for communications skills-building. Our initial focus is on Mentors, but we are thinking inclusively about the needs and capacity of the entire Openscapes community.

***PURPOSE:***<br>
Mentors have requested skills-building. A haphazard approach introduces more cognitive load without providing clarity about why it's worth doing. This wastes energy and undermines enthusiasm. Comms skills are hard enough to acquire - we need all the clarity and dedication we can get.

***OBJECTIVES:***<br>
a visible scaffolding that shows how each skill and concept fits into the whole and supports learners at any point in their own development, and in whatever domain they're drawn to first.

### Collaborators on this project
Liz Neeley (lead) + Julie Lowndes

### The problem
We want to build out a thoughtful program for support self-guided and mediated communication skills development. We need to help people figure out where to start, what to focus on, and in which order.
